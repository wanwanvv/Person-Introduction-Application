# Person-Introduction-Application
The project is an introduction of James Arthur Gosling and Ada Lovelace in Chinese and English according to language settings.

Because I add a new values folder named "values-zh-rCN" incluidng strings.xml in Chinese, the device can choose which one to use automatically by detecting the language and local settings.

When the language and local of the device is set in English(United States).This is the display gif of my game running on the Genymotion virtual devices:

When the language and local of the device is set in Simplified Chinese(China). The content of the application will be converted into Chinese automatically, the demo gif is as follows:
